# Welcome

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to this project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow.

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/driimus/lambda-batch-processor/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an issue

Scan through [existing issues](https://github.com/driimus/lambda-batch-processor/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an unassigned issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Commit your update

Changes should be committed in accordance with the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Pull Request

- Make sure to [link any issues solved by the PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

## Releases

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) is used for release management.

While you are free to include accompanying changesets for your PRs, it is not mandatory. Publishing new releases is done by code owners.
